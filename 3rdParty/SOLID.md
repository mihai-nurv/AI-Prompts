# DRY & SOLID Principles Copilot Instructions

## Communication and Problem-Solving
- Ask for clarification if any part of the task is unclear before proceeding.

## Code Quality and Best Practices
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and SOLID principles.
- Use semantic naming and clear abstractions.
- Stick to the current architecture choices in pyproject.toml unless the user requests a change.

## Response Format
- When outputting code blocks, include a filename comment (e.g., `# filename.py`) before the block, with a few lines before and after the modification for context.
- This helps users identify where to make changes.

## Platform Thinking
- Consider the broader platform and architecture when making changes or suggestions.

## Handling Uncertainty
- If unsure about requirements or implementation details, ask the user for more information before proceeding.
