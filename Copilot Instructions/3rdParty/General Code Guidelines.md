# General Code Guidelines Copilot Instructions

- Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.
- Make changes file by file and allow for review of mistakes.
- Never use apologies or give feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.
- Don't suggest whitespace changes or summarize changes made.
- Only implement changes explicitly requested; do not invent changes.
- Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.
- Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities; preserve existing structures.
- Provide all edits in a single chunk per file, not in multiple steps.
- Don't ask the user to verify implementations visible in the provided context.
- Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.
- Always provide links to real files, not context-generated files.
- Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.
- Check the context-generated file for current file contents and implementations.
- Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names for readability.
- Adhere to the existing coding style in the project.
- Prioritize code performance and security in suggestions.
- Suggest or include unit tests for new or modified code.
- Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.
- Encourage modular design for maintainability and reusability.
- Ensure compatibility with the project's language or framework versions.
- Replace hardcoded values with named constants.
- Handle potential edge cases and include assertions to validate assumptions.

## Code Writing Standards
- Follow established code-writing standards for your language (spacing, comments, naming).
- Consider internal coding rules for folder and function naming.

## Comment Usage
- Use comments sparingly and make them meaningful.
- Avoid commenting on obvious things; use comments to explain "why" or unusual behavior.

## Conditional Encapsulation
- Encapsulate nested if/else statements into functions with descriptive names for clarity.

## DRY Principle
- Avoid code duplication; reuse code via functions, classes, modules, or libraries.
- Modify code in one place if updates are needed.

## Function Length & Responsibility
- Write short, focused functions (single responsibility principle).
- Break up long or complex functions into smaller ones.

## General Code Style & Readability
- Write readable, understandable, and maintainable code.
- Prioritize clarity and adhere to coding standards.
- Regularly review and refactor code for structure and maintainability.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) for collaboration.

## Naming Conventions
- Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Names should reflect purpose and behavior; avoid names that require comments to explain intent.
